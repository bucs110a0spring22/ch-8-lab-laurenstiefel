## GRACE DAYS
Grace days used for this assignment: < 0 >

Grace days remaining: < 5 >/5

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 I wasn't able to convert the return statements to strings in some of the tests so I commented out those lines in the main code to allow my code to run. Additionally, some of the tests didn't return the proper values
